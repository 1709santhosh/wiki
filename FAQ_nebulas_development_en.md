## Questions about setting up environment

##### Q:  How to start my node in local environment?

>A: You can refer to the official tutorial: https://github.com/nebulasio/wiki/tree/master/tutorials. If you encounter some problem, try to search in the github issues of `go-nebulas` and `wiki` and probably you will get new finding.

##### Q:  Do I need to start a local node to participate in the official incentive program?

> A:  Not necessary. You can use web-wallet (https://github.com/nebulasio/web-wallet ) to deploy the contract on testnet and mainnet.

##### Q: I am using a  mac. Why isnâ€™t my library installed correctly?

> A: There are also some small partners in the community who have encountered similar problems. Most of the reason is that you need to run `brew update` to update brew version, and then the installed dependencies are compatible.

##### Q: I am using windows operating system. Can I start the node locally?

> A: You can install the virtual machine to start the node locally. 

##### Q: I am using Windows operating system. Can I deploy smart contracts to participate in this incentive plan?
> A: Yes, web-wallet and other components support running in the windows environment.

##### Q: I built a node in the local according to the official tutorial to test, is there any way to modify the default settings for faster debugging?

> A: Of course there are ways to change the time interval and the number of dynasties for each block. For details see:
https://github.com/nebulasio/go-nebulas/issues/109

##### Q: After the installation is complete, start Neb locally and report an error "Make build libnebulasv8.so cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory". What's going wrong?

> A: Usually due to missing v8 files. Please check carefully if you missed make deploy-v8 during installation. Or try solving the problem at https://github.com/nebulasio/go-nebulas/issues/93.

##### Q: Git clone too slow

> A: If the content to be downloaded is large, network jitter will cause the download to fail. You can try to configure the proxy. For details, refer to https://github.com/nebulasio/go-nebulas/issues/88.

##### Q: When sending a request to a node, occasionally "503 error ("error": "all SubConns are in TransientFailure")?

> A: There are two situations. One is that the number of network connections on the NEB node is too large, and the upper limit is reached. This situation can be retried later. The other is the local encounter after the first compile and start, this time you can try to restart the machine to solve. Since the second situation is more difficult to reproduce, the suspect may be that some of the resources in the system have not been released and the government will continue to look for better solutions.

##### Q: When sending a request to a node that is set up by itself, chrome shows 501 not implemented. The server does not support OPTIONS requests. Would you like to ask whether this is not supported by nebulas?

> A: modify local config
     rpc {
     ...
     http_module: ["api","admin"]
     # HTTP CORS allowed origins
     +  http_cors: ["*"]
     }

##### Q: Where to get a quick start

> The official launch of the tutorial  provide a step-by-step guide for the nebula fans on how to develop their own DApp on the Nebula. See official blog:

##### Q: How to use wallet to interact with Nebulas?
> A: For basic tutorials, see the official feature release introduction 
> https://github.com/nebulasio/web-wallet 

##### Q: How to query the content of the deployed contract?

> A: The  status can be found in web-wallet or https://explorer.nebulas.io/#/ via the transaction hash returned when deploying contract.

##### Q: Can the deployed contract be upgraded directly or support data migration to a new contract?

> A: No, you need to redeploy the smart contract.

##### Q: Does the contract need to consume gas, and what is the lower limit?

> A: Gas must be consumed when the contract is deployed or called. The consumption of gas in the development of the Nebulas is not expensive, and the gaslimit range is [20000, 50000000000]. Gasprice defaults to 10^wei. Note that 1NAS=1^18wei, the actual consumption is very low.

##### Q: How to check the transaction history of my account?
> A: Enter your account address at https://explorer.nebulas.io/#/

##### Q: Why does the transaction I send have been pending?
> A: The usual reason is that you have entered too big nonce when sending transactions. Nonce is executed sequentially. You can query the current state of the account (getAccontState) to ensure that the nonce you send is continuous.

##### Q: Why can't I find out the contract I deployed?
> A: There are usually two possibilities. The first is a deployment failure. You can query the completion status in web-wallet or https://explorer.nebulas.io/#/ by returning the transaction hash. The second situation is that you accidentally set up the wrong network and mistakenly testnet/mainnet

##### Q: Can I inquire about the content of the contract through the contract address?
> A: The query status of the current contract is queried by the transaction hash. The official has completed the function of querying through the contract address today and will be online soon. Please look forward to it.

##### Q: What if my contract has a bug and I want to fix it?
> A: Redeploy a contract. Point your DApp interface request to the new contract.

##### Q: How to apply nas tokens when testing on the test network?
> A: https://testnet.nebulas.io/claim/

##### Q: Where will console.log be printed in smart contract?
> A: Currently printed in the background log of the neb node. If there is a need to print logs for local test, please check the documentation to start the node locally.

##### Q: Considering that users may have concerns about uploading private keys, how can you easily develop DApps on the web?
> A: A Chrome-Extension wallet from community enthusiasts could be helpful (https://github.com/ChengOrangeJu/WebExtensionWallet). The wallet provides functions such as send transactions / import wallet / call contract method / query transaction status, which would reduce the workload of web developers significantly when developing DApps.
